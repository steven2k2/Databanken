    <!-- About Us Section -->
    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 fw-bold">About Us</h2>

    <p class="mb-3">
      <span class="fw-semibold">{{siteMetadata.name}}</span> is an independent not-for-profit organisation based in Melbourne. We started recycling and refurbishing computers in 1998.
      Our low-cost computers are refurbished by skilled volunteers for Australian Concession Card holders and other eligible customers.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      We install Linux on all our computers with useful software that suits most people. Not only is Linux software free,
      but it is a genuine alternative to the proprietary software Microsoft Windows.
      We may be able to assist with installing other systems if our customers require.

    <!-- Long-Term Savings -->
    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 fw-bold">Long-Term Savings</h2>

    <p class="mb-3">
      One of our customers has been with us for 12 years. He has spent $250 total in buying three refurbished computers from Computerbank over that time.
      He has saved a few thousand dollars by not buying new computers each time.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Using Linux keeps the costs of computing much lower, instead of paying money every few years for the latest paid applications,
      not to mention the annual cost of antivirus software.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      By using a refurbished computer, you are helping the environment by giving a highly manufactured piece of equipment a second life.
    </p>

    <!-- Donations and Recycling -->
    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 fw-bold">Donations and Recycling</h2>

    <p class="mb-3">
      <span class="fw-semibold">{{siteMetadata.name}}</span> receives donated computers, laptops, and tablets and refurbishes them with quality free software.
      Computers are donated to us by businesses, educational institutions, not-for-profits, and individuals.
      Our computers are offered to disadvantaged individuals and community groups.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3 fw-bold">We Recycle Responsibly</h3>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Any computer parts that are found to be broken or have reached the end of their useful life do not end up in landfill.
      The metals are sent to scrap recyclers here in Melbourne or sometimes sold through our eBay page.
      <span class="fw-semibold">{{siteMetadata.name}}</span> will not allow our obsolete equipment to be sent to unsafe dismantling plants in third-world countries.
