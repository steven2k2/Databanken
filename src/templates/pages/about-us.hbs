    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 fw-bold">About Us</h2>

    <p class="mb-3">
      <span class="fw-semibold">{{siteMetadata.name}}</span> is an independent not-for-profit organisation based in Melbourne. We started computer refurbishment in 1998.
      Our low-cost computers are refurbished by skilled volunteers for Australian Concession Card holders and other eligible customers.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      We install Linux on all our computers with useful software that suits most people. Not only is Linux software free,
      but it is a genuine alternative to proprietary software such as Microsoft Windows.
      We may also assist with installing other systems upon request.

    <!-- Long-Term Savings -->
    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3 fw-bold">Long-Term Savings</h2>

    <p class="mb-3">
      One of our customers has been with us for 12 years. He has spent $250 total in buying three refurbished computers from <span class="fw-semibold">{{siteMetadata.name}}</span> over that time.
      He has saved thousands of dollars by not purchasing new computers each time.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Using Linux keeps computing costs much lower, instead of paying for new applications every few years, plus the recurring cost of antivirus software.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      By using a refurbished computer, you are helping the environment by giving a highly manufactured piece of equipment a second life.

    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3 fw-bold">We Recycle Responsibly</h3>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Any computer parts that are found to be broken or have reached the end of their useful life do not end up in landfill.
      The metals are sent to scrap recyclers here in Melbourne or sometimes sold through our eBay page.
      <span class="fw-semibold">{{siteMetadata.name}}</span> will not allow obsolete equipment to be sent to unsafe dismantling plants in developing countries.
