    <p class="mb-3">
      Our affordable, refurbished computers are available for concession card holders, students, pensioners, and community groups.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      All our computers are refurbished and quality assured and come with a three-month back-to-base warranty.
      For desktops, the warranty is extended to six months, provided that you do not replace the Linux operating system.
      All our computers have Linux and useful open-source software already installed, and they come with a free user guide.
