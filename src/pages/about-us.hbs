        <p>One of our customers has been with us for 12 years, spending just $250 on three refurbished computers. By choosing refurbished computers, our customers save thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>Using Linux helps lower computing costs by eliminating recurring software fees and antivirus costs.</p>
        <p>Refurbished computers also help the environment by extending the lifespan of technology.</p>

        <h5>We Recycle Responsibly</h5>
        <p>Obsolete or broken computer parts do not end up in landfill. Instead, metals are sent to Melbourne-based scrap recyclers or sold via our <a href="#">eBay page</a>. We do not send obsolete equipment to unsafe dismantling plants in third-world countries.</p>
