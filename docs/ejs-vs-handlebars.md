# **EJS vs Handlebars: Which One is Better?**

Both **EJS** and **Handlebars** are great templating engines, but the best choice depends on your project’s needs.

---

## **🔍 Key Differences**
| Feature              | **EJS** 🟢 | **Handlebars** 🔵 |
|----------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Syntax Style**     | JavaScript-based (`<%= %>`) | Logic-less, Mustache-style (`{{ }}`) |
| **Logic Support**    | Full JS logic (`if`, `for`, etc.) | Limited (only simple expressions) |
| **Extensibility**    | Allows inline JavaScript | Uses helpers/partials for logic |
| **Performance**      | Slightly faster (direct JS execution) | Slightly slower (precompiled, safer) |
| **Learning Curve**   | Easy for JS devs | Simple for designers/non-devs |
| **Use in Webpack**   | Works well, integrates easily | Needs `handlebars-loader` for Webpack |
| **Maintainability**  | Can get messy with complex logic | More structured & readable |

## **🛠 When to Choose What?**
### **Choose EJS if:**
✅ You need full JavaScript logic inside templates  
✅ You prefer a familiar syntax (`<%= variable %>`)  
✅ Your project already uses Express (EJS is built-in)  
✅ You need better performance (EJS is slightly faster)

### **Choose Handlebars if:**
✅ You want clean, logic-less templates for separation of concerns  
✅ Designers or non-JS developers will work on the templates  
✅ You need built-in helpers & partials for reusability  
✅ You want a safer approach (prevents inline JavaScript execution)

## **🚀 Recommendation for Your Webpack Project**
Since you are using **Webpack with static files**:
- **Handlebars is a better fit** because of its **precompilation and better maintainability**.
- If you **don’t need inline JS logic**, Handlebars keeps your templates clean and easy to read.

If your project moves towards **server-side rendering (Express-based)**, then **EJS** could be a better fit.
