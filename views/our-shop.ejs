        <p>
            Our affordable, refurbished computers are available for concession cardholders, students, pensioners, and community groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            All our computers are refurbished and quality assured and come with a three-month back-to-base warranty. For desktops, the warranty is extended to six months, provided that you do not replace the Linux operating system. All our
            computers have Linux and useful open-source software already installed and come with a free user guide.

        <h2>Desktop Computers</h2>
        <p>
            We usually have around 10 desktop computers in stock and ready to go at any time. You can view a live updated list via our stocklist.
        </p>
        <p>
            Members of the public who do not hold a concession card are still able to purchase a desktop from us; however, prices are 50% higher (e.g., a $50 desktop would be $75). All our Linux-based computers are internet-ready, have word processing, and more.
